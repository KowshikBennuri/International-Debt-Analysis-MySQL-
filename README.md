# Analysing-International-Debt-Statistics (MySQL)
It's not exclusively individuals who accumulate debt to address their needs; nations may also incur debt to manage their economies. For instance, investing in infrastructure is a costly necessity for countries to ensure their citizens' quality of life. The World Bank serves as the primary institution offering financial assistance to countries.

This project entails analyzing international debt data compiled by The World Bank. The dataset comprises information regarding the indebtedness of developing countries across various categories, measured in USD. The objective is to address inquiries such as:

1. What is the total debt amount owed by the countries included in the dataset?
2. Which country possesses the highest debt amount, and what is its magnitude?
3. What is the average debt amount owed by countries across different debt indicators?

The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from The World Bank, encompassing debt statistics for numerous countries globally, recorded from 1970 to 2015, including both national and regional data.
